The organization was founded in 1982 and has since grown to become one of the largest international relief and development organizations in the United States.

        Food For The Poor provides essential resources such as food, housing, healthcare, education, and emergency relief to impoverished communities in the region. They work with local partners to identify the most pressing needs and develop sustainable solutions that empower communities and promote long-term change.
        
        One of the unique aspects of Food For The Poor's approach is their commitment to transparency and accountability. The organization has earned the highest ratings from charity watchdog groups for their financial responsibility and effectiveness.
